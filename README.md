# Short_Term_Load_Forecasting_RNN_Project

This repository contains the code and dataset used for our research paper on: "Short-Term Load Forecasting Employing Recurrent Neural Networks". 

Here's the link to the research paper on IEEE: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10577742

The code includes implementation of our LSTM and GRU models. The dataset used is our enhanced version of the ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) dataset focused on the West region.

Breif description about the project:
*With rising energy demands, predicting electricity usage accurately is crucial for efficient grid management and sustainable energy use. The research uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically LSTM and GRU models, to forecast short-term electricity load. By incorporating features like weather, holidays, and time data, we enhanced the model's accuracy, aiding in the development of smarter energy grids to meet future demands reliably.*
