Breif description about the project:
With rising energy demands, predicting electricity usage accurately is crucial for efficient grid management and sustainable energy use. The research uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically LSTM and GRU models, to forecast short-term electricity load. By incorporating features like weather, holidays, and time data, we enhanced the model's accuracy, aiding in the development of smarter energy grids to meet future demands reliably.
